This is the project of Yusuf Ali Hilooglu for the course "Big Data" in Radboud University.

The source code is written to be ran on a HDFS with necessary Spark dependencies met. So, it is not possible to just clone the repo and use the code. One of the main reasons for this is that I cannot store a webcrawl segment within GitHub.

To get the implementation details and get informed about the results, one can take a look at "Results.pdf".
